= CONFORMANCE TESTING OF TIMESLOT ADVERTISER - OBSERVER


== PROJECT FEATURES TO TEST

The project contains an example of advertiser usage, where the Timeslot
advertiser runs with an advertisement interval of 100ms, alongside a
SoftDevice-powered connectable advertiser with an advertisement interval
of 150ms.


== Required Software/Hardware

. NRF51 Development Kit        (PCA10028)
. Signalling Unit
.. Keysight Technologies T1212 (formerly AT4 wireless)
.. BITE Protocol Tester        (release 1.0.16.0)
.. Test Manager                (version 2.0.142.230)

== TEST SPECIFICATION

. LL.TS.4.2.1
